# dotfiles
Hey there! Welcome to my dotfiles repository. This document will explain what setup I use.

## Editor: nvim
I use nvim for everything text and code related. For Java projects, I use IntelliJ, but other than that, most of my work is done in nvim.

nvim is important for some functionality in my dotfiles, for example, a windowed fuzzy finder that is similar to that of Sublime Text.

## Terminal: iTerm2 with zsh
I'm using zsh on iTerm2. I don't really use many of its features, but that might change soon. For now, I just use tmux for window and tile management.

## Color schemes
As you can probably guess, I really loved the Sublime Text color scheme so I am using it for my iTerm2 and my vim/nvim color scheme.
