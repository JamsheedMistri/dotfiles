# dotfiles
Hey there! Welcome to my dotfiles repository. This document will explain what setup I use.

## Editor: nvim
I use nvim for everything text and code related. For Java projects, I use IntelliJ, but other than that, most of my work is done in nvim.

nvim is important for some functionality in my dotfiles, for example, a windowed fuzzy finder that is similar to that of Sublime Text.
